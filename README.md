# MICRO-LAB-4
 # OBJECTIVES
The main objective of this lab is for you to develop a small water level controlling system of a water tank using the knowledge of interrupts and other programming techniques of PIC16f877a from all the labs we did throughout the course.<br>

# INTRODUCTION
The purpose of the project is to create a system that automatically controls the water level. The implementation of the proposed system is based on PIC microcontroller and 3 infra-red sensors, which is used to measure the water level within a tank and based on this measurement, the two DC motors are turned ON or OFF automatically. The experimental results show that the proposed system is succeed in measuring the water level and turning the water pump ON or OFF according to the water level<br>

Electronic circuits known as PIC microcontrollers can be configured to perform a wide variety of activities. They can be programmed to act as timers, manage a production line, and do a lot more things. A PIC microcontroller can be programmed using a number of different software. There are people who still use Assembly language to program PIC Microcontrollers.<br>

An electrical device that monitors and detects infrared radiation in its environment is called an infrared (IR) sensor. Infrared sensors come in active and passive varieties. Infrared radiation is both produced and detected by active infrared sensors. A light emitting diode (LED) and a receiver are the two components of an active IR sensor. The receiver detects the infrared light from the LED that reflects off an object as it gets close to the sensor.<br>

DC motors are used in this system. A sort of electric machine that transforms electrical energy into mechanical energy is a direct current (DC) motor. Direct current (DC) motors take electrical power and turn it into mechanical rotation. With the help of magnetic fields produced by electrical currents, DC motors rotate a rotor placed within the output shaft. The electrical input and the motor's design both affect the output torque and speed.<br>

A printed circuit board, or PCB, is used to mechanically support and electrically connect electronic components using conductive pathways, tracks or signal traces etched from copper sheets laminated onto a non-conductive substrate. All the components here are connected through the pcb board.<br>

# PROCEDURE

1.	First the pcb design was created using the proteus software.<br>

2.	Then the pcb board was made by using that design. To make it a cu board and ferric chloride was used.<br>

3.	And then the components used are soldered to the pcb board as in figure ….<br>

4.	Then the code that use to program the pic microcontroller was written using the MP labs software and uploaded it into the pic microcontroller using pickit 3.<br>

5.	Then it was connected to the pcb board using the pic adaptor.<br>

6.	After that three sensors and the motor module was connected to the pic16F877A.<br>

7.	Then the motors were connected to the motor module.<br>
